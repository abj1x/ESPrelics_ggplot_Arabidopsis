# ggplot map of Spain
## with location of relic and non-relic AUGCA ESP LHY haplotypes for Arabidopsis 1001 genome accessions

## Description
can be used to subset datasets in tidyverse to prepare a map of Spain with ESP Arabidopsis accessions collected by the Arabidopsis 1001 genomes project

This example: Supplemental Fig 4d of James et al. (2018) Global spatial analysis of Arabidopsis natural variants implicates 5'UTR splicing of LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL in responses to temperature. Plant Cell Environ. 41(7) 1524-38.
